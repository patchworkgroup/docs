# Unfuddle git workflow
As our projects are almost always very simple, this is the workflow that we will follow 99% of the time.

Rules of thumb:
- Always pull before you push
- Always pull in the beginnig of the day
- Always push before you go home
- Don't push broken code (without notifying other collaborators that your feature is not yet working)
